# Note Taker App Challenge
by Logan Sutton


## Description

Using Node.js, Express.js, and starter code (for all of the front end files), the goal of this project was to develop the back-end server files to make the app functional.

The purpose of the app is to allow a user to create and save notes, including the ability to view or delete saved notes.
From the root page, click on the 'Get Started' button to direct the user to the `Notes` page. Select the `Note Title` field to type a title and in the `Note Text` field to type a note. Click on the 'save' icon that appears in the upper right-hand corner to save the note to the list in the left column. Select a note from the list to view. Click on the `+` button in the upper right-hand corner to create a new note. Click on the 'delete' icon next to a note to permanently remove that note. The `Note Taker` link in the upper left-hand corner directs the user back to the home page.

Project development involved writing a basic server.js file using Express.js as well as GET, POST, and DELETE requests to add functionality to the app, to read, write to, and remove data from a db.json file. A UUID package is also used to generate unique ids for the saved note files, necessary for retrieving and deleting saved notes.
